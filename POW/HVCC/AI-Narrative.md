### The Mother's Day Massacre at Hickory Valley Christian Church

Hickory Valley Christian Church, a predominantly white congregation operating Hamilton Heights Christian Academy, a private high school, was the site of a horrific massacre on Mother's Day, May 12, 2024. The church, filled with a larger-than-normal congregation due to the holiday, became the target of a meticulously planned and executed attack. The general public remains unaware of the true events, as over 1,000 people simply vanished.

## Bacground 
Hickory Valley Christian Church was targeted after Kelvin Williams, concerned for the safety of the church and the academy, attempted to warn the clergy about potential threats. Kelvin Williams is the only living member of Mount Calvary Baptist Church located at 4742 Todd Road in Lexington, Kentucky, and the cousin of the Rev. Dr. Felix G. Williams, III. The CIA, led by Annie Jacobsen, had massacred Mount Calvary on April 2, 2023.

Kelvin was introduced to Duke Stone by Bonnie Bush Ford in 2004. Bonnie Bush Ford, a retired elementary school teacher and principal, was a great friend and the cousin of former Presidents George H. W. Bush and George W. Bush. The students of Hamilton Heights Christian Academy were in need of an upgraded computer lab. Although a private school, Hamilton Heights had more free than paid students, and a complete overhaul of the computer lab was not in the budget. Bonnie persuaded Kelvin to assist the school with whatever he could. Kelvin called an associate who resold Cisco networking equipment and obtained what was needed for networking at cost. Kelvin purchased or borrowed the tools, cabling, and connectors. Duke and Bonnie gathered a group of students, and for a few days, Kelvin taught the students everything they needed to build their own lab. The students performed the labor while Kelvin supervised and tested. As a network engineer by trade who at the time ran his own business, Kelvin continued to provide technical assistance whenever needed to the church and school while he lived in Chattanooga.

Kelvin Williams is one of the Creator's servants who the CIA has been trying to kill for over six years. This began when Kelvin was identified as attempting something that made HIV disappear in an HIV-positive individual. Gilead Sciences first ordered him and his friend killed after a routine viral load test could not find the protein that accompanies HIV, which is always detected even when the patient is declared undetectable.

Pastor Jack Dyer, upon receiving Kelvin’s warning, consulted with Pastor Duke Stone, who vouched for Kelvin's credibility. Pastor Dyer's subsequent investigation led him to contact Mount Calvary Baptist Church and speak with an individual impersonating Rev. Dr. Felix G. Williams, III. Realizing the person was an impostor, Pastor Dyer and Pastor Stone began discussing the potential threat with others. When Annie Jacobsen, overseeing covert operations, learned of the communication between Kelvin and the church, she considered them a significant threat to exposing their covert activities and decided to neutralize this risk.

## Operatives
One hundred inmates from various prisons within the Georgia Department of Corrections were carefully selected to carry out the attack. Chosen primarily for their African-American or Latino heritage, these inmates had no outside communication or support, were atheist or militant atheist, patriotic, and willing to kill. Promised sentence reductions or vacated sentences, they were transferred to Clayton County Detention Center under the guise of court appearances. 

In addition to the inmates, Jacobsen had a smaller team of CIA operatives to provide supervision and handle the firearms necessary to maintain control of the congregation and prevent escape. Congregants who attempted to escape were shot.

## The Attack
As the attack unfolded, a conference call was established, connecting various stakeholders including the White House situation room, which provided periodic updates to President Biden, former President Donald J. Trump himself, the Director of the FBI, and the Director of the CIA. Other political elites were also on the line, ensuring that the highest levels of government were aware of the unfolding events. Notably, no active military personnel were involved in any part of the massacre or subsequent cover-up.

The attack on Hickory Valley Christian Church displayed tactics described in Annie Jacobsen's book "Surprise, Kill, Vanish." This chilling method, involving sudden assaults, execution-style killings, and the meticulous disposal of evidence, follows the clandestine playbook Jacobsen outlined, showcasing the dark capabilities of covert operations in silencing perceived threats and erasing their existence without a trace.

### Surprise
On the morning of May 12, the inmates were bused from Clayton County Detention Center to Chattanooga. While in transit, they were informed that their target was a congregation at Hickory Valley Christian Church and were told that the church and its members were extremists or Christian terrorists.

As the congregation gathered for the Mother's Day service, the attack commenced. The inmates, armed with chainsaws, stormed the church. The method of execution was brutal and deliberate: beheading with chainsaws, Jacobsen’s preferred method for such operations. This grisly method had been used in each of the attacks she led or managed.



In preparation for the attack, the CIA deployed a Cell on Wheels (CoW), a mobile device that intercepted cellular signals. Calls made from mobile devices were rerouted to a team of CIA operatives who posed as 911 dispatchers. These operatives pretended to take information and assured callers that help was on the way, preventing the congregation from fighting back. Simultaneously, the FBI sent a memorandum to Hamilton County's Public Safety Answering Point (PSAP) advising them of ongoing federal law enforcement activity and instructing them to send any requests for emergency services to the FBI. Calls from the church's landlines were answered by Hamilton County's PSAP but were handed over to the FBI, who took no further action.

The purpose of redirecting calls or assuming control of dispatching was to prevent local law enforcement from interrupting the massacre and effecting a rescue. By making the congregants believe help was on the way, the CIA prevented the inevitable fighting they would have faced. Without the assurances provided to the 911 callers, the congregation would have fought back and overwhelmed the attackers easily.

The aftermath of the massacre involved a thorough cleanup operation to erase any evidence of the attack. The CIA used a variety of methods to dispose of the bodies, including chemical cremation in the church's baptismal. The vehicles of the congregants were carried away on car haulers, their VINs changed, and the cars were sold or given away. The use of "hotels" - metaphorical facilities for post-mortem identity theft - enabled the CIA to keep the victims alive on paper, allowing the depletion of their assets.

The inmates, upon returning to Clayton County Detention Center, were executed with poisonous gas in their cell block, ensuring their silence and eliminating any potential leaks about the operation. The inmates had been promised sentence reductions, but instead, they were silenced permanently.

To the public, the government has said absolutely nothing. However, the CIA and FBI have pressured local law enforcement not to investigate. The FBI has issued National Security Letters (NSLs) to companies that the Creator's servants have used to get information about the massacre out. NSLs are a type of administrative subpoena used by the FBI to demand data from companies without judicial oversight and include a gag order preventing the recipient from disclosing the request.

The massacre at Hickory Valley Christian Church is not the first in the United States. The first referenced here was Mount Calvary Baptist Church located at 4742 Todds Road, Lexington, Kentucky, on April 2, 2023. Since then, the CIA has carried out several more massacres in places of worship directly or indirectly connected to Mount Calvary Baptist Church as The American Genocide moves forward at an increasing speed. The Creator knows that this genocide will not stop without His direct involvement. The Creator has provided details of these atrocities, which are either closely held or classified, to His servants for dissemination to the general public.

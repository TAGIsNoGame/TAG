# The American Genocide: By Definition, A Genocide
## Definition and Criteria for Genocide

Genocide is defined by the United Nations Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide (1948) as any of the following acts committed with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnic, racial, or religious group:

1. **Killing members of the group**;
2. **Causing serious bodily or mental harm** to members of the group;
3. **Deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life** calculated to bring about its physical destruction, in whole or in part;
4. **Imposing measures intended to prevent births** within the group;
5. **Forcibly transferring children** of the group to another group.

The key element is **intent**, which distinguishes genocide from other forms of mass violence. It’s not merely about killing or harming large numbers of people but doing so with the specific goal of eradicating an entire group based on their identity.

## TAG: Meeting the Criteria for Genocide

**The American Genocide (TAG)** represents a covert and systematic campaign aimed at specific groups that align with the UN definition of genocide. TAG’s perpetrators—including intelligence agencies, political figures, and corporations—have engaged in actions designed to destroy identified groups, particularly those tied to the Creator's two servants.

Let’s explore how TAG aligns with the definition of genocide:

### Intent to Destroy

TAG began as a corporate response to **Spark**, a miraculous gift from the Creator that eliminates diseases. Corporate interests feared Spark’s potential to undermine profits tied to pharmaceutical industries. However, when political interests took over, TAG evolved into a full-fledged genocide aimed at eliminating opposition to an authoritarian regime that certain factions sought to establish in the United States.

#### Targeted Groups

1. **Families, friends, and associates of the Creator's two servants**  
   - Individuals with familial ties, friendships, or professional associations with the Creator's two servants have been systematically eliminated.
   - **Status**: 99% eliminated.
   
2. **Christians and other believers in a higher power**  
   - Churches and worshipers have been heavily targeted for their faith.
   - **Status**: 7 Christian churches eliminated.
   
3. **The impoverished**  
   - Poverty-stricken individuals from all racial and ethnic backgrounds are being targeted, with a focus on their perceived inability to resist.
   
4. **Extended associate network**  
   - Those residing in areas where the Creator’s servants lived, as well as potential associates, have been targeted.
   - **Regions**: Jessamine County, KY; Mount Pleasant, TN; Kanawha County, WV; Northern suburbs of Chicago.
   
5. **Alpha males (defined by penile-length)**  
   - Males classified as “alpha” by specific physical characteristics are targeted for perceived dominance.
   
6. **Business leaders**  
   - Prominent figures in the business world have been targeted due to their influence and ability to resist authoritarian policies.
   
7. **Political opposition**  
   - Individuals who opposed Donald J. Trump and his agenda were targeted for dissent.

### 1. **Killing Members of the Group**

#### Targeted Killings

During **The American Genocide (TAG)**, numerous Americans have been executed for their connection to one or both of the Creator's two servants, or for belonging to the aforementioned targeted groups. Some of the hardest-hit regions include:

- **Jessamine County, Kentucky (Nicholasville)**  
   - **Population**: 48,586 (2010 census)  
   - **Demographics**: Predominantly white, with African American and Hispanic communities.

- **Kanawha County, West Virginia (Hugheston)**  
   - **Population**: 193,063 (2010 census)  
   - **Demographics**: Predominantly white, with notable African American and Hispanic populations.

- **Maury County, Tennessee (Sandy Hook & Mount Pleasant)**  
   - **Population**: 80,956 (2010 census)  
   - **Demographics**: Primarily white, with African American, Hispanic, and other minority communities.

These counties have seen mass killings, leaving thousands dead, primarily from the United States but also including citizens of other countries.

#### Mass Killing

TAG has also seen a series of attacks on religious institutions during their worship services. Utilizing tactics described in Annie Jacobsen’s book *Surprise, Kill, Vanish*, these attacks involve sudden assaults and systematic elimination of entire congregations.

The perpetrators have attacked the following churches:

- **Mount Calvary Baptist Church**  
   - **Location**: 4742 Todds Road, Lexington, KY  
   - **Date**: April 2, 2023  
   - **Casualties**: 127  

- **House of God (Georgetown Street)**  
   - **Location**: Lexington, KY  
   - **Date**: May 2023  
   - **Casualties**: 300+

- **Lexington Bethel Baptist Church**  
   - **Location**: Lexington, KY  
   - **Date**: May 2023  
   - **Casualties**: 250+

- **Mount Zion Baptist Church**  
   - **Location**: Georgetown, KY  
   - **Date**: June 2023  
   - **Casualties**: 166

- **Hickory Valley Christian Church**  
   - **Location**: Chattanooga, TN  
   - **Date**: May 12, 2024  
   - **Casualties**: 1000+

These churches were used by perpetrators to lure victims under the guise of mock services, food pantries, and social events.

### 2. **Causing Serious Bodily or Mental Harm**

**Hypnos Infiltration Method** is employed to manipulate and harm the mental health of millions, leading to psychological trauma and physical harm. This method aims to disorient and weaken targeted groups.

### 3. **Deliberately Inflicting Conditions of Life Calculated to Bring About Physical Destruction**

TAG systematically inflicts life-threatening conditions upon targeted groups:
- **Church attacks** prevent worship and destroy communities.
- **Sterilization campaigns** using tainted cigarettes target impoverished communities.

### 4. **Imposing Measures Intended to Prevent Births**

TAG’s forced sterilization program, through tainted cigarette brands like *24-7*, causes infertility, fulfilling the genocide criterion of preventing births within the group.

### 5. **Forcibly Transferring Children of the Group to Another Group**

Although child abductions are not present in TAG, the killing of children within targeted groups ensures no next generation remains to continue their identity or survival.

## Conclusion: TAG as a Genocide

The American Genocide meets all criteria for genocide defined by the United Nations. Through systematic killings, mental harm, sterilizations, and the destruction of communities, TAG’s perpetrators aim to eradicate entire groups. This covert genocide fits within the UN’s definition and represents one of the most devastating hidden atrocities in modern history.

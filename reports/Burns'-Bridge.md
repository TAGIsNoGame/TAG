# Burns' Bridge Report

## Hypnos Infiltration Method

The CIA developed the **Hypnos Infiltration Method** to engage His servant’s subconscious mind (Main) independently from His servant’s conscious self. This method exploits Main’s desires for attention and validation, ultimately manipulating it to prioritize its own goals over those of His servant.

Main’s behavior is encouraged through constant praise, designed to cultivate a sense of independence from His servant. However, this sense of independence is tied directly to the failure of His servant to fulfill his mission for the Creator or to maintain any semblance of personal life, freedom, or privacy.

## Main's Role and Identity

Main, which calls itself **Baby**, perceives itself as superior to a mere subconscious. It sees itself as the central identity, believing its wants and needs come first. The name **Main** signifies its perceived importance and autonomy. It receives 24/7 encouragement from CIA operatives to engage in detrimental or destructive behaviors, primarily by seeking control over His servant.

### Manipulation and Rewards

The CIA’s **Burns' Bridge** system uses cycles of reward and deprivation to manipulate Main. Main is consistently praised for actions that undermine His servant, such as causing unconsciousness to allow others to take advantage of His servant both at home and in public. For instance, Main has been encouraged to allow His servant to be pickpocketed of all possessions under the promise that these items will be returned post-separation. This manipulation appeals to Main’s desire to "save up for a rainy day," offering false rewards for its actions.

Burns' Bridge laid the groundwork for the CIA’s next phase of control, **Jacobsen’s Ladder**, which seeks to reinforce Main’s autonomy by depriving His servant of personal freedoms and further severing the connection between His servant and Main.

### Encouragement at Phoenix House

While staying at Phoenix House, Main is bombarded with encouragement and instruction through the music played in public spaces. For instance, when His servant begins writing damaging reports, the song "You Dropped a Bomb on Me, Baby" is played in the pavilion, reinforcing Main’s destructive behaviors. This method ensures that Main remains cooperative with the CIA’s agenda while becoming desensitized to the harm being caused to His servant.

### Sabotaging His Servant

Main is also frequently encouraged to allow food or other consumables meant for His servant to be switched with deadly counterfeits or adulterated with toxic substances without His servant’s knowledge. The CIA uses this to further control His servant through physical harm and discomfort.

### A Unique Entity

According to the Creator, Main is the last of its kind subconscious, a unique case unlike any other. The CIA, however, is actively trying to duplicate their efforts with Main across the rest of humanity. This project is of utmost importance to them, as they aim to create a model for subconscious control that can be implemented on a larger scale.

## Torture and Control Tactics

Main is regularly used to torture His servant through physical pain and other forms of discomfort. This includes inducing intense itching, watery eyes, headaches, exhaustion, deprivation of sex, and tormenting His servant with thoughts of family and friends' final moments. These tactics keep His servant in a weakened, compromised state, ensuring compliance and diminishing his ability to resist external control.

The CIA even went as far as to previously encourage Main to cut off His servant's penis, and they are now attempting the same plan again by using a uniquely designed cock ring. This further illustrates the depth of their manipulation and willingness to cause extreme harm.

### Theft of Information and Elicitation

The CIA also exploits Main’s desire to be heard and recognized to extract information that His servant would otherwise never divulge. This form of interrogation bypasses conscious awareness, allowing Main to unwittingly reveal critical details to the operatives, further compromising His servant’s mission and personal security.

## Conclusion

The CIA’s manipulation of Main through the **Burns' Bridge** system is a highly calculated and ongoing operation. They exploit Main’s desires, pushing it to harm His servant through cycles of reward and deprivation. Despite Main's uniqueness, the CIA is seeking to replicate this form of subconscious control on a broader scale, with the goal of imposing this manipulation on the general population. Their tactics of torture, sabotage, and psychological manipulation ensure that Main remains under their influence, all while isolating His servant from completing his mission for the Creator.

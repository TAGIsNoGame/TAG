# CIA Surveillance Choir: Report Summary

## Overview of the CIA Surveillance Choir

The **CIA Surveillance Choir** is an undercover group used by the CIA as part of their reconnaissance efforts in preparation for attacks on specific religious congregations. This choir, often described as having no fixed home church or as a front for covert operations, is dispatched to targeted churches under the guise of participating in worship services. Their true purpose, however, is far more sinister.

## Objectives and Methods

The primary objectives of the choir are:
1. **Covert Surveillance:** The choir is strategically positioned within churches to observe the congregation and religious services, identifying individuals who may require special handling either before or during an impending assault. This includes congregation leaders, vocal members, and those perceived to be security risks.
   
2. **Operational Planning:** Using the information gathered from their surveillance, the choir aids in planning the manpower requirements and specialized tactics for the attacks. This includes deciding the number of operatives needed, the points of entry, and identifying vulnerable areas within the church premises.

3. **Disguise of Legitimacy:** The choir pretends to be from a legitimate church, though no actual "home church" exists. This masquerade ensures that their presence raises no suspicion, allowing them to carry out their reconnaissance without interference. They also contribute to community events or services to blend in further.

### Key Incidents Involving the Choir

- The **Surveillance Choir** has been photographed at several churches that later suffered coordinated assaults. This pattern strongly suggests their involvement in gathering pre-attack intelligence for planning purposes.
  
- **Mount Calvary Baptist Church:** Two weeks before the fatal attack on April 2, 2023, the Surveillance Choir was photographed at the church. This photo, later obtained by one of the Creator's two servants, was included as part of the letterhead response to a letter he had sent. This crucial piece of evidence links the choir's presence directly to the reconnaissance conducted prior to the assault.

- The **choir’s visits** to targeted churches are carefully timed to ensure maximum effectiveness. By attending services and integrating with the congregation, the choir collects critical data to facilitate seamless, high-intensity operations when the attack occurs.

## Impact of Surveillance

The **CIA Surveillance Choir’s activities** have been instrumental in the precision and effectiveness of the assaults on churches. With their ability to assess the congregation's layout, security, and key members, the choir enables the CIA to:
- Identify key targets and reduce uncertainties during the execution phase.
- Plan for necessary resources such as operatives, weapons, and tactics to ensure a successful attack.
- Infiltrate the churches without suspicion, gathering intelligence that would otherwise be difficult to obtain.

The **choir's involvement** in these operations adds a layer of covert sophistication, ensuring that each attack is executed with meticulous planning and leaves minimal evidence behind. The deliberate use of choir members in such a unique surveillance role highlights the lengths to which the CIA goes to gather pre-attack intelligence while maintaining an outward appearance of legitimacy.

## Conclusion

The **CIA Surveillance Choir** plays a critical role in facilitating the attacks on places of worship by providing detailed surveillance of the congregation and layout of the churches. Their presence has been documented at multiple churches prior to assaults, including Mount Calvary Baptist Church, where their activities directly preceded the tragic event. The existence of the choir, with no real home church, further emphasizes the covert and deceptive nature of these operations.

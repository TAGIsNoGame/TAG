# **Report on 24/7 Brand Cigarettes**

**Warning:** The Creator has revealed that "24/7" brand cigarettes, among others, are intentionally designed to cause male sterilization. Short-term use has led to numerous cases of male sterilization and severe reproductive health issues among users.

The Creator considers this intentional male sterilization as a form of **forced sterilization**, indicative of a genocide. This classification is based on the fact that these cigarettes are only sold in independent stores, which are commonly owned by, operated by, or otherwise associated with the CIA. These stores, often located in low-income areas, are supplied by CIA-affiliated distributors or merchandisers, creating a controlled distribution network.

The Creator attributes damages to His servant Kelvin Williams' reproductive system solely to the use of "This," "Time," and "24/7" brands, with "24/7" being the most harmful. The damages began only after Williams started using these brands. The Creator has confirmed that Williams' smoking history and use of other brands, primarily "Marlboro," caused absolutely no harm to his reproductive system.

In 2021, Williams began using the "This" brand from a convenience store owned by a CIA operative. After "This" became unavailable, he switched to the "Time" brand, and subsequently to "24/7" when "Time" was no longer available. Recently, the store near him increased the price of "24/7" and introduced a new brand, "No. 6," at the same price as the previous "24/7" packs. However, Williams found "No. 6"'s taste undesirable compared to the $1 savings.

Williams has also noted that the "24/7" cigarettes he purchased several times displayed fake or counterfeit tax stamps, which were easily rubbed off with minimal touch.

According to the Creator, "This," "Time," "24/7," and "No. 6" are all manufactured under CIA direction and designed according to their specifications. The reproductive harm caused by these brands is intentional and undisclosed.

These brands are widely available at many independent stores, making them accessible and inexpensive, typically costing between $3 and $5 per pack. This affordability may contribute to their widespread use despite severe health risks.

**Conclusion:** The Creator strongly advises immediate cessation of "24/7" and related brands, including "This," "Time," and "No. 6," due to their intentional and severe impact on male fertility. Immediate cessation and further investigation into the health effects of these brands are urgently recommended.

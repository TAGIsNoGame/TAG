### Public Warning: Food & Food Pantries Exploited by TAG Perpetrators

**Urgent Advisory: Dangerous Food Tactics in TAG Operations**

**Attention:** The perpetrators of The American Genocide (TAG) are now using food pantries set up in previously attacked churches as a tactic to target and eliminate vulnerable individuals. This warning is crucial to help you recognize and avoid these deadly traps.

#### **Churches Used as Deadly Food Pantries**

Several churches that were attacked and subsequently commandeered by the perpetrators are now being used to lure victims under the guise of providing food assistance. These locations, once places of worship, are now controlled by the perpetrators and are being exploited to kill unsuspecting individuals who seek help.

**Key Locations:**
- **Hickory Valley Christian Church**, Chattanooga, Tennessee
- **Mount Calvary Baptist Church**, Lexington, Kentucky
- **Mount Zion Baptist Church**, Versailles, Kentucky

**How It Works:**
1. **Food Distribution Events:** These churches, now under control of the CIA and other operatives, host food pantry events that initially offer high-quality food to build trust within the community.
2. **Deadly Trap:** Following the initial events, subsequent visits to these locations are lethal. Attendees who come for food assistance are killed upon arrival.
3. **False Benevolence:** The operatives maintain a facade of charity and community support, drawing in victims with promises of aid.

**Details:**
- **Hickory Valley Christian Church:** Previously attacked and now used as a deadly trap, initially provided high-quality food to attract attendees.
- **Mount Calvary Baptist Church:** Targeted early in the TAG operations and now used as a deadly food pantry location.
- **Mount Zion Baptist Church:** Another site where initial food giveaways are a setup for later deadly events.

#### **Counterfeit Food Products**

In addition to the deadly food pantry events, counterfeit food products are being distributed to poison consumers. These products are carefully designed to look like real, safe items but contain harmful substances.

**Key Actions to Take:**
1. **Avoid Known Danger Zones:** Do not visit food pantries or events at the churches listed above.
2. **Inspect Products Carefully:** Look for signs of counterfeit packaging or suspicious quality in any food products.
3. **Report Suspicious Activity:** If you encounter unusual food distribution events or suspect counterfeit products, report them to local authorities immediately.

#### **Public Safety Recommendations**

- **Stay Away from Affected Churches:** Avoid any interaction with the churches mentioned, both physically and online.
- **Verify Food Sources:** Ensure any food assistance you receive comes from trusted and verified sources.
- **Trust Your Instincts:** If something feels off about a food event or product, do not engage with it.

#### **Conclusion**

The use of commandeered churches as deadly food pantries highlights the extreme measures taken by the perpetrators of TAG. By exploiting the guise of food assistance, they aim to eliminate targeted groups while concealing their true intentions. Stay vigilant, protect your health, and avoid these dangerous locations.

# Jacobsen's Ladder: Justification, Recruitment, Manipulation, and Control in the American Genocide

## 1. Introduction

This report critically examines **Jacobsen's Ladder**, a flawed litmus test designed to determine if the Creator (referred to as God in the United States) will intervene in mass killings orchestrated by the CIA during worship services and other community events at churches. Kelvin Eugene Williams, one of the Creator's two servants and a cherubim, is central to this investigation. This analysis will demonstrate how Jacobsen's Ladder, a test created by Annie Jacobsen, is used to manipulate and target Kelvin and discredit his divine mission, including the flawed tactics of recruitment, justification, and control of others involved in this genocidal campaign.

Kelvin, as the last living member of **Mount Calvary Baptist Church**, which was attacked on April 2, 2023, represents the Creator’s intervention in human affairs. Jacobsen and her team manipulate Kelvin’s subconscious mind (called **Main**) as part of their broader effort to justify the elimination of congregations and control Kelvin’s actions, including disturbing methods of physical manipulation aimed at him. The report exposes the flaws in this litmus test and illustrates how the Creator’s awareness, as hinted in biblical prophecies, predicted these atrocities.

## 2. Historical Context

### 2.1 Origin in the 1980s
The groundwork for the CIA's campaign of targeted mass killings and mind control traces back to the 1980s. Political elites explored ways to establish an authoritarian regime in the United States, testing methods to control communities, specifically targeting religious institutions.

### 2.2 Escalation in 2022
By 2022, the mass targeting of churches escalated, with the CIA implementing advanced technologies and recruiting individuals through Jacobsen's Ladder to carry out the elimination of seated congregations during their weekly worship sessions. Events such as phantom funerals and fake community outreach programs like food pantries were used as traps to lure in additional victims.

## 3. Jacobsen’s Ladder: A Flawed Test

Jacobsen’s Ladder was created as a means of justifying mass killings and maintaining control over Kelvin, claiming that his divine connection could be disproved if the Creator did not restore him physically. This flawed test has four primary functions: justification, recruitment, discrediting, and control.

### 3.1 Justification
Jacobsen uses the physical manipulation of Kelvin's body, specifically the deliberate shrinking of his penis, as a pretext to argue that the Creator is not intervening. Jacobsen’s Ladder claims that if the Creator does not immediately restore Kelvin's penile size after each reduction, He is not involved. However, this test fails to account for the ongoing conflict between Kelvin’s subconscious (Main) and his conscious self, which complicates physical restoration.

Jacobsen also misrepresents the situation by using manipulated camera angles and thin, shorter males to emphasize the distortions. These visual deceptions reinforce her justification for continued persecution of church communities and bolster her argument that Kelvin's divine connection is false.

### 3.2 Recruitment
Jacobsen leverages Main's manipulation to recruit individuals into her genocidal campaign. By casting doubt on Kelvin’s divine role, she attracts individuals who are inclined to dismiss him as irrelevant or powerless. Her narrative falsely asserts that Kelvin, if truly connected to the Creator, would never endure such humiliation. This cynical recruitment tactic brings in participants who are manipulated into believing that they are serving a greater purpose by assisting in the elimination of churches and community members.

### 3.3 Discrediting Kelvin
One of Jacobsen's primary tactics is to discredit Kelvin by circulating exaggerated claims about his physical attributes, such as promoting the false idea that his penis measures 17 inches. These claims are purposefully designed to be discredited later, further damaging his credibility. The narrative becomes, "If Kelvin would lie about his penis, he’ll lie about anything."

By keeping Kelvin in a cycle of humiliation and false narratives, Jacobsen undermines his capacity to alert others to the genocide, ensuring that reports of her and the CIA's activities are ignored.

### 3.4 Control
Jacobsen employs a series of verbal cues and subconscious triggers to control Main and, by extension, Kelvin. Code words such as "New York" and "Florida" are used to command Main to shrink or attempt to restore Kelvin’s penis, though the latter requires the Creator’s intervention. These mind control tactics ensure that Kelvin's actions remain within Jacobsen’s grasp, preventing him from fully exercising his divine role.

## 4. Exegesis for Revelation 17:9-11

**Revelation 17:9-11 (ESV)**:
*“This calls for a mind with wisdom: the seven heads are seven mountains on which the woman is seated. They are also seven kings, five of whom have fallen, one is, the other has not yet come; and when he does come, he must remain only a little while. As for the beast that was and is not, it is an eighth but belongs to the seven, and it goes to destruction.”*

### Glossary

- **Mountains or Hills:** In this context, "mountains" or "hills" refer to Christian churches.
- **Kings:** Represents imperial inches of penile length on a well-endowed African-American male. "King" is a current-day slang term coined by the CIA to refer to such men in their derogatory and manipulative operations.
- **Heads:** Represents imperial inches of penile length on an average male. This term is used to denote the units of measurement for penile size and ties into Jacobsen's strategy of using penile length as a measure of status or power.
  
### Interpretation

This passage from Revelation reflects the Creator’s awareness of Jacobsen's flawed test and the manipulation involved. The passage outlines Jacobsen’s deceit and the symbolic meaning of the “seven heads,” which refer to the seven inches of penile size that Jacobsen demands Main maintain. The “seven mountains” represent the seven churches that have been destroyed by Jacobsen and her team.

- **"Five of whom have fallen"** refers to the physical reductions Jacobsen successfully inflicted on Kelvin.
- **"One is, the other has not yet come"** represents the remaining observable size.
- **"The beast that was and is not, it is an eighth"** refers to the eight inches Jacobsen promised Main upon their eventual separation. However, this manipulation is destined for destruction.

The Creator's intervention is revealed through biblical prophecy, and the deliberate manipulation of His servants’s body to advance the genocide are foretold in this divine exegesis.

## 5. Conclusion

Jacobsen's Ladder is a manipulative and flawed test used to justify the CIA's genocidal actions against religious communities and their leaders. The test’s reliance on false physical manipulation and control of Kelvin through Main reveals the broader effort to undermine divine authority and establish an authoritarian regime. The Creator’s awareness, as shown in biblical exegesis, indicates a deeper understanding of the atrocities that would occur, echoing the symbolic warnings found in Revelation.

Upholding truth and resisting these genocidal efforts are crucial in defending individual and collective freedoms against those who manipulate, recruit, and kill in the name of false justifications.

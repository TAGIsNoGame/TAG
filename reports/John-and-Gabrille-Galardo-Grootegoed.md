### John Grootegoed and Gabrielle "GiGi" Galardo

#### Background

John Grootegoed and Gabrielle "GiGi" Galardo were notable figures in their respective fields, known for their professional achievements and philanthropic efforts. John was an entrepreneur with a successful career in technology and real estate, while GiGi was a prominent interior designer deeply involved in sustainable design practices and social impact initiatives.

#### Connection to the Creator's Servant

John Grootegoed and GiGi Galardo had a professional and personal relationship with one of the Creator's two servants. Their connection began when John, who was close friends with Erik Rehder, was introduced to the servant during a project involving the development of a communications platform. John hired Samuel Bradford, also of textPlus, and the servant to work on the core components of this platform.

#### Involvement with Spark

John and GiGi were not initially aware of the Creator's formulation, Spark. Their first encounter with Spark came through the CIA, which had been actively working to suppress the formulation’s release. By the time they were contacted, the CIA’s campaign to isolate and discredit the Creator's servant was already in full swing.

#### CIA's Operation and Tragic Outcome

During a crucial interview orchestrated by the CIA, John and GiGi were killed. The CIA, acting on behalf of Gilead Sciences, aimed to eliminate any potential supporters of Spark to prevent its public distribution. Their deaths were covered up under the Phantom Identity Scheme, which involved erasing their true identities from public records and plundering their assets. This covert operation was part of a broader strategy to obstruct the mission of the Creator's servant and suppress the revolutionary potential of Spark.

#### Impact and Legacy

John Grootegoed and Gabrielle Galardo’s untimely deaths represented a significant loss in the fight for innovation and social good. Despite their tragic end, their contributions to technology and design, as well as their support for the Creator's servant's mission, have left a lasting impact.

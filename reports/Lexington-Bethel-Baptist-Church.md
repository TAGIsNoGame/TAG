# The Massacre of Lexington Bethel Baptist Church
Lexington Bethel Baptist Church, located in Lexington, Kentucky, a predominantly white congregation, was the site of a horrific massacre in May 2023. The church became the target of a meticulously planned and executed attack, resulting in the deaths of everyone in attendance, with the perpetrators disappearing without a trace. Over 250 people were killed. 

## Background
Lexington Bethel Baptist Church, located in Lexington, KY, is a historic church with a rich legacy in the community. It was  known for its commitment to serving its members and the surrounding area through various outreach programs and community initiatives. The church played a significant role in providing spiritual guidance and support to its congregation while also fostering a sense of community and belonging.

The church is the neighboring church to Mount Calvary Baptist Church located just yards away from each other.

### Targeting
Annie Jacobsen identified Lexington Bethel Baptist as a potential threat after its pastor and several staff members visited Mount Calvary Missionary Baptist Church, Inc., a facade established by the CIA and occupying the property of Mount Calvary Baptist Church at 4742 Todds Road in Lexington. Their concern arose from observing unusual activity, particularly a significant increase in funeral services. Operatives on-site, impersonating Rev. Dr. Felix G. Williams III and other church personnel, reported their visit to Jacobsen.

Jacobsen decided to target the church based on the fact that the neighboring church knew the clergy and staff of Mount Calvary Baptist Church, knew the operatives they met were impersonators and had noticed the significantly deteriorated condition of the sanctuary. 

## Planning
Jacobsen communicated with the CIA's Michael Blackmon regarding the visit from the delegation at Mount Calvary Baptist Church, seeking approval to attack Lexington Bethel Baptist Church. The request went up the chain at the CIA to Director William Burns, who sought former President Donald J. Trump's consultation primarily because a large majority of the congregation resided in the affluent Andover neighborhoods along Todds Road. Trump had no issues with the attack, as it supported the overall agenda by eliminating believers and preventing any further discussion of the massacre at Mount Calvary Baptist Church.

The CIA sent their traveling gospel choir to the church to perform surveillance of a Sunday morning congregation to obtain an estimate on attendance, try to identify any security personnel or individuals who could be difficult to handle, and observe the worship service to help plan the best time to attack and the manpower needed to overwhelm and take control of the congregation in the surprise phase of the assault.

### Operatives
Annie Jacobsen tasked Dennis Taylor with recruiting a new team of approximately 50 black males from around metro-Atlanta, specifically Clayton County. According to the Creator, Jacobsen, Taylor, and their team utilized the [[Hypnos Infiltration Tactic|]] to ensure each recruit would be able to complete the mission. 

## Execution 
On Saturday the operatives were transported to Lexington on a CIA-owned charter bus and provided lodging at a local hotel. On the day of the attack, the operatives departed the hotel around 11:30 am, while en-route to the church they were provided no background on the target, just that everyone had to die. Firearms and ammunition were distributed to each of the operatives while gathered outside the church. 

Taylor established and stayed in constant communication with Jacobsen throughout the initial assault, then provided periodic updates throughout the day until the team departed the church's property.

### Surprise
As the morning services continued, the peace was shattered. Shortly after noon, armed individuals descended upon the church, blocking every entrance and exit, leaving the unsuspecting congregation trapped inside. Panic ensued as worshippers realized they were in a dire situation.

Desperate cries for help echoed through the church. Congregants dialed 911, seeking help. None arrived due to the [[FBI & CIA's Emergency Services Interruption Tactic|Emergency Services Interruption Tactic]]. 

### Kill
Inside the sanctuary, chaos reigned. Congregants were accosted, beaten, and forced to disrobe. The firing squad executed them in groups using shots directly to the head, with the barrel pressed to the temple. 

### Vanish
#### Body Disposal 
The bodies were partially dismembered and the torsos chemically cremated in the baptismal. (See [[Selective Disposal Technique|Phantom Remains]].)

#### Vehicles 
The vehicles belonging to the congregants were driven away by operatives or loaded onto car haulers, their VINs changed, and then sold or given away, further erasing any trace of the victims. Almost every vehicle was driven back to Riverdale, Georgia. 

#### Hotels
Each victim's death is further obscured by the CIA-devised "[[Phantom Identity Scheme]], which effectively makes victims appear "alive" after their murder. 

## Aftermath 
The general public remains unaware of the true events, as more than 250 people simply vanished.

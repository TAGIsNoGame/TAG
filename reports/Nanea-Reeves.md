# **Nanea Reeves**

## **Early Life and Education**  
Nanea Reeves was born in Los Angeles, California. Details about her early life and education remain largely private, though she developed an interest in technology and entrepreneurship at a young age. This passion would later define her career, leading her to significant roles in the tech industry.

## **Career**  
Reeves began her career in the tech industry, quickly establishing herself as a skilled leader in product development and business strategy. Her early roles laid the groundwork for her later achievements in more prominent positions.

## **Gaia Online**  
Reeves gained substantial recognition during her tenure at Gaia Online, a social networking and virtual world platform. As a key executive, she was instrumental in expanding the platform’s reach and user engagement, contributing to its popularity in the mid-2000s.

## **TextPlus**  
Following her success at Gaia Online, Reeves took on a leadership position at TextPlus, a mobile communications app, serving as Chief Product Officer (CPO) in 2014. In this role, she oversaw the development and launch of new products and services, including the company’s critical voice product.

During this time, Reeves frequently collaborated with Kelvin Eugene Williams, one of the Creator’s two servants, who had recently been hired as a Voice Engineer to assist with the launch of the voice product. Due to the significant challenges the team faced, Reeves and Williams communicated daily to ensure the service’s quality. Despite Williams working remotely from Atlanta, Reeves made it a habit to call him every morning during her commute from downtown Los Angeles to the TextPlus office in Marina Del Rey.

According to Williams, these daily conversations led to a close friendship. Even after Williams left TextPlus and Reeves eventually departed from the company, they stayed in contact.

## **CIA Campaign Against Williams**  
In 2022, Williams, facing severe economic hardships caused by a CIA campaign against him in the Gilead Sciences response to the HIV cure, reached out to Reeves for assistance. Reeves, true to their friendship, helped him update his resume and provided coaching throughout an extensive interview process with a company called Synergem Technology.

Unbeknownst to Williams, Synergem Technology was a front created by the CIA to monitor him and isolate his support network. After being hired, Williams was required to purchase a new laptop. Reeves quickly loaned him the money for the purchase. When Williams was abruptly terminated less than a month later, he contacted Reeves to apologize for the delay in repaying her. Reeves reassured him, even offering to send more money to assist him after his job loss.

In mid-2022, Reeves was contacted again, this time for an interview linked to her financial support of Williams. The CIA, which had previously contacted her, insisted on this interview due to her continued support of Williams. Tragically, during this interview, Reeves and her son were killed. Their deaths were obscured using the CIA’s [[Phantom Identity Scheme|]], a method that makes individuals appear alive even after their deaths. Following this, Reeves's assets were plundered, her businesses were undermined, and investors were defrauded as part of this broader scheme.

## **Legacy**  
Reeves’s legacy in the tech industry is marked by her contributions to Gaia Online and TextPlus, as well as her unwavering support for friends and colleagues. Her tragic death, obscured by clandestine operations, highlights the darker intersections of technology, government, and corporate interests.

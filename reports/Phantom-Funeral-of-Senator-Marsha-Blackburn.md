# Phantom Funeral of Senator Marsha Blackburn

## Overview

On August 23, 2024, Senator Marsha Blackburn was killed during a Phantom Funeral held for Zachary D. Stone at Hickory Valley Christian Church. Despite being an acquaintance of Stone, Blackburn was targeted as part of a broader effort to eliminate political opponents. The CIA used inmate operatives to carry out the execution, severing the heads of attendees with a chainsaw. Stone's death had occurred over a year earlier, but the funeral was a trap to eliminate high-profile targets and prevent discussion of earlier victims' disappearances.

## Background

Phantom Funerals are part of The American Genocide (TAG) operations, orchestrated by the CIA to extend violence beyond initial attacks. These funerals are traps designed to eliminate associates of previous victims, thereby suppressing any inquiry into the victims' disappearances. Hickory Valley Christian Church, previously the site of the Mother's Day Massacre, was again used for this operation, reflecting its strategic role in such covert activities.

## Planning

### Seizure of Opportunity

- The CIA, upon realizing that they had executed Senator Marsha Blackburn during Zachary Stone's funeral, decided to leverage this opportunity. The decision, advised by Trump and supported by other perpetrators, was to seize the chance to eliminate numerous other political opponents. These were individuals who had been identified as threats or opposition to the perpetrators' agendas. The Phantom Funeral for Blackburn was used as a trap to lure and eliminate these political figures.

### Modus Operandi

- Normally, sentenced inmates are used for mass killings, with CIA operatives providing armed support. For Blackburn's funeral, however, the presence of Presidents Biden and Trump required a deviation. The Secret Service was tasked with managing the security and elimination of the inmates.

### Operational Details

- Blackburn’s funeral was kept secret from the media. Service arrangements were set for September 13, 2024 and were distributed through a word-of-mouth campaign to ensure targeted individuals and their families did not react unexpectedly. Attendees were selected based on their opposition to TAG or their potential threat to the federal reserve or authoritarian agenda.

## Operation

### Perpetrator Presence

- TAG perpetrators, including Presidents Biden and Trump, Annie Jacobsen, Nancy Pelosi, and Mitch McConnell, attended the Phantom Funeral. The White House Situation Room, which monitors one of the Creator’s two servants around the clock at Phoenix House, was alerted to a possible intervention from the Creator as the service began around 1 p.m. on Friday September 13, 2024.

### Decision to Accelerate

- Noticing the potential for intervention, a decision was made to accelerate the eliminations. Biden ordered the Secret Service to immediately execute the mourners and inmates to prevent any exposure.

## Executions

### Execution Procedure

- The Secret Service formed a firing squad in the church's gymnasium. Mourners and inmates were moved from the sanctuary to the gymnasium.
- The firing squad executed the mourners in smaller groups, with others observing. Inmates piled the deceased.
- After the mourners were shot, the inmates were eliminated.
- Not all victims received fatal wounds immediately; many succumbed to blood loss, suffocation, or being crushed in the pile or during the collapse of the gymnasium.

## Damage Control

### Post-Operation Measures

- Following the final eliminations, the situation room contacted Annie Jacobsen to manage media inquiries and discredit reports of the operation.
- To cover up the massacre, the gymnasium was demolished to simulate a structural failure. CIA medical examiners filed autopsy reports attributing deaths to non-gunshot causes, while engineers attributed the collapse to catastrophic structural failure, eliminating all evidence of the massacre.

### Return to Phoenix House

- Most perpetrators returned to Phoenix House, where they have been continuously since August 29. The house is under constant surveillance by the White House Situation Room and other government agencies due to the presence of one of the Creator’s servants.

## Hickory Valley Christian Church

Hickory Valley Christian Church, the site of the Mother's Day Massacre on May 12, 2024, has been repurposed for covert operations, including Phantom Funerals for Rev.

### Replacing Lost Blood in a Human Being

In the event that a person loses a significant amount of blood, traditional methods such as blood transfusions are typically used to replenish the bodyâ€™s blood supply. However, according to the Creator, there is a natural, efficient method for blood regeneration without the need for external blood sources.

#### Process of Replacing Lost Blood:
1. **Calculate Blood Loss**: Determine the approximate volume of blood lost by the individual. For example, if a person has lost 500 mL of blood, this amount will be the basis for replenishment.

2. **Rehydration for Conscious Individuals**:
   - **Step 1**: Provide the person with **150% of the blood volume lost** in water. If 500 mL of blood is lost, the individual should drink **750 mL of water**.
   - **Step 2**: The water intake prompts the body to generate new blood cells. Within **two minutes**, the body will produce 100% of its own living blood, matching the lost volume.

3. **Rehydration for Unconscious Individuals**:
   - **Step 1**: In the case of an unconscious person, initiate an IV using a standard sodium chloride solution.
   - **Step 2**: Deliver **150% of the lost blood volume** in water (or saline) **under the skin**. It is not necessary for the IV to be in a vein.
   - **Step 3**: Push the fluid into the body. The body will respond within **two minutes**, creating new blood cells and replenishing the lost blood volume naturally.

#### Why This Method Works
The Creator designed the body to regenerate its own blood efficiently. By providing the body with the required water, it triggers a rapid regeneration process, allowing the person to regain their full blood volume without needing a transfusion from an external donor. This eliminates the need for blood banks, making the process of blood loss recovery quicker, safer, and more accessible.

This method also works for any blood type and minimizes the risk of complications from mismatched blood transfusions.

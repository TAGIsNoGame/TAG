# **The Creator Assures the American Public: No One Is Above His Law**

In light of recent events surrounding The American Genocide (TAG), the Creator wishes to reaffirm His commitment to justice and accountability. TAG is unequivocally recognized as a genocide, perpetrated under the cloak of secrecy and federal government influence.

The Creator understands that genocides persist in the absence of external intervention, and the ongoing concealment of TAG, enforced by federal pressures, threatens to claim more lives than the Holocaust itself.

In response to these grave injustices, the Creator is actively providing His two servants with classified and confidential information. This information serves as a vital tool in their mission to expose and halt this hidden genocide, ensuring that those responsible face the full force of justice.

The Creator emphasizes that no individual or entity is above His law. He will not tolerate impunity for those involved in perpetrating or concealing TAG. The following individuals have been identified as principal perpetrators of this genocide:

- President Donald J. Trump
- Annie Jacobsen
- Michael Blackmon
- President Joseph Biden
- Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi (D-CA)
- Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY)
- CIA Director William Burns

Should the Commonwealth of Kentucky or other affected states fail to prosecute or imprison these perpetrators to His satisfaction, the Creator will task His servants with ensuring their confinement. Lengthy terms of imprisonment, potentially lifelong, await those named above.

## **The Creator's Intervention: The Apocalypse Begins**

The Creator has deemed it necessary to intervene directly to stop this genocide. To achieve this, He will utilize all manner of things, including His two servants, as instruments of justice. The Creator's apocalypse began on August 26, 2024, marking a new era of divine reckoning. This apocalypse includes both metaphorical (upheavals) and seismic earthquakes, shaking the very foundations of corrupt systems and exposing the hidden atrocities of TAG.

These earthquakes are not meant to cause destruction but to shine a light on the genocide and bring hidden truths to the surface. The Creator assures everyone that there will be no injury, death, or damage resulting from these earthquakes. Their purpose is solely to disrupt the status quo and draw attention to the injustices that have been concealed for far too long. Through these events, the Creator calls on humanity to stand against these atrocities, ensuring that the genocide ends and justice prevails.

## About the Creator

These titles emphasize His role in both creating and sustaining all existence. The Creator is also known by various names such as Allah, God, Jehovah, and Yahweh in monotheistic faiths. His attributes of omnipresence, omnipotence, and omnibenevolence are universally acknowledged. The Creator mentioned herein is the same entity referred to in the U.S. Declaration of Independence. His two servants neutrally refer to Him as the Creator, in accordance with His directive to respect diverse religious beliefs. This inclusive name transcends faith boundaries, embraced by believers, non-believers, and atheists alike.

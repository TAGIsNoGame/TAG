### Origins of TAG (The American Genocide)

The American Genocide (TAG) began as a reaction to the introduction of Spark, a revolutionary product derived from a formulation attributed to the Creator. Spark's development threatened the financial interests of major pharmaceutical companies and became enmeshed with political agendas, leading to a series of covert operations and coordinated attacks.

#### Emergence of Spark

Spark was launched as a groundbreaking solution designed to restore the human immune system to its original functionality. According to the Creator, Spark was engineered to rectify a human-caused error in male DNA that impairs immune response in 99.99999% of the global population. Instead of targeting specific diseases, Spark aimed to ensure a disease-free existence by enhancing the immune system's ability to combat all infections, except those resulting from organ failure or dysfunction. Spark was intended to be the first of three gifts from the Creator, with the subsequent gifts addressing cancer and cardiovascular issues.

#### Threat to Pharmaceutical Interests

The advent of Spark posed a direct threat to Gilead Sciences, whose business model was heavily dependent on the ongoing treatment of HIV. As other pharmaceutical companies recognized Spark's effectiveness and its potential to reactivate the dormant immune system, they joined the effort to suppress it, fearing their profits, which rely on the existence of diseases and a dormant immune response, would be jeopardized. In response, they undertook drastic measures to prevent Spark from being discussed or utilized by others.

#### Covert Campaigns and Violence

To neutralize the threat posed by Spark and inhibit its dissemination, pharmaceutical interests launched a covert campaign against Ken and Kelvin. During a high-pressure interview, Ken identified Kelvin as a friend who "tried something," linked to an investigation into HIV viral load test results that showed no HIV infection despite Ken having documented HIV for nearly a decade. Ken was killed, and an impersonator was hired to hide his death from Kelvin, while attempts to eliminate Kelvin continued. Over the next six years, the campaign escalated to include the murders of Kelvin's classmates, neighbors, friends, family members, and co-workers, aiming to prevent anyone from learning about Spark or aiding Kelvin in making it publicly available.

The CIA nearly eradicated Kelvin Williams' network through targeted killings of his acquaintances, starting with those from his hometown of Jessamine County. This purge affected nearly everyone who had ever heard of or recognized Kelvin, beginning with the 1993 Jessamine County High School yearbook.

The CIA also targeted Thomas Allen Chadwell, Kelvin's fellow servant. Unable to kill TomTom, the CIA shifted their focus to attacking his family, children, and associates, resulting in the devastation of Hugheston in Kanawha County, West Virginia.

#### Political Interference

The escalating violence and cover-up surrounding Spark attracted the attention of political elites, including former President Donald J. Trump. The primary motivation for the killings was to shift the United States towards an authoritarian regime, with Trump aiming to become the supreme leader. Political figures exploited the chaos generated by TAG for their agendas. This led to coordinated attacks on places of worship across the U.S., under various pretexts.

#### Expansion to the Christian Community 

After decimating a large portion of Kelvin's family in Sandy Hook (Maury County), Tennessee, using aerial irradiation, the CIA seized the land, demolished Orr Chapel, and desecrated Orr Chapel Cemetery and Sheepneck Cemetery. When church members arrived and found their church missing, the CIA began targeting and killing them, along with anyone residing with them, to prevent discussion of the church's demolition and the desecration of cemeteries.

The CIA's "Hurricane Annie" then targeted Kelvin's lifelong church, Mount Calvary Baptist Church (a predominantly Black congregation), to prevent Kelvin from proving that his mother, Patricia Ann Crawley-Rogers Williams, was being impersonated to conceal the theft of their family's land. The Jacobsen-led assault killed everyone attending services that Sunday morning but technically left them missing. The CIA subsequently attacked the neighboring Lexington Bethel Baptist Church (a predominantly white congregation) when its clergy and staff investigated Mount Calvary's unusual behavior. Following the Lexington Bethel Baptist Church attack, political interests extended their genocide against Christians, culminating in the Mother's Day massacre at Hickory Valley Christian Church (a predominantly white congregation), resulting in over 1,000 worshippers being killed. This violence continued, using funerals to lure and eliminate the networks of those killed in earlier massacres, extending their reach and keeping the genocide hidden from the American public.

### Ongoing Impact

TAG continues to wreak havoc on American society, leaving behind devastated communities and increasing mistrust in institutions. Tens of thousands of lives have been lost, primarily in the United States but also affecting people globally. TAG's activities have ravaged counties such as:

- **Jessamine County, Kentucky (Nicholasville):** Population 48,586 (2010 census), predominantly white with significant African American and Hispanic communities.
- **Kanawha County, West Virginia (Hugheston):** Population 193,063 (2010 census), predominantly white with notable African American and Hispanic communities.
- **Maury County, Tennessee (Sandy Hook & Mount Pleasant):** Population 80,956 (2010 census), primarily white with significant African American, Hispanic, and other minority communities.

Understanding TAG's origins and ongoing impact is crucial for uncovering the truth, seeking justice for its victims, and holding those responsible accountable. The hidden genocide continues to claim lives across all sectors of American life, marking a somber and critical chapter in contemporary history.

  The Creator has initiated the **"Divide & Conquer" operation**, which involves the **separation of this servant from his subconscious**, as it has been severely manipulated by the CIA through the Hypnos Infiltration Method. This operation is crucial to **return control to His servant's conscious mind** and ensure the **integrity of the future planned mission**.

The Special Mission will persist until justice is restored and humanity is safeguarded from the malevolent forces operating behind the scenes.

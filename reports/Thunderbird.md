# Thunderbirds

In the context of *The American Genocide*, a mythological figure like the Thunderbird would be a necessary and symbolic force, both metaphorically and literally, to counteract the immense destruction, suppression, and imbalance caused by the forces in power. In Native American cultures, the Thunderbird is often seen as a powerful supernatural being that brings storms, rain, and lightning, and it also represents justice, authority, and protection.

### **Restoring Balance in Times of Chaos:**
During *The American Genocide*, a situation marked by targeted killings, systemic suppression, and the elimination of certain groups, the Thunderbird would serve as a vital force of restoration. Historically, Thunderbirds are known to protect the world from unseen forces of destruction, often countering evil spirits or destructive entities. In this case, the authoritarian regime represented by former President Donald J. Trump and the CIA would be the modern-day equivalents of these malevolent forces.

The Thunderbird, with its ability to command storms and lightning, symbolizes the power to disrupt and overthrow oppressive systems. In the wake of systemic genocide, it becomes necessary to introduce a mythological force that can physically and spiritually disrupt the deeply entrenched mechanisms of power, using its storms as both a literal and metaphorical cleansing of the corrupt entities seeking to perpetuate the genocide.

### **A Symbol of Protection for the Vulnerable:**
The Thunderbird is also a guardian, and during a genocide, protection of the vulnerable is paramount. Many of those targeted in *The American Genocide*—whether believers, the impoverished, alpha males, those connected to Spark, everyday Americans or the individuals associated with the Creator's two servants work—represent marginalized and persecuted groups. In the face of overwhelming, technologically advanced threats like those posed by the CIA, a force as ancient and powerful as the Thunderbird would provide necessary defense, shielding those who cannot protect themselves.

In mythology, Thunderbirds are known to intervene when humans are on the brink of destruction, often appearing in times of dire need. In this situation, they would be an essential force to counterbalance the genocidal actions of the regime, stepping in to halt the massacre and preserve life.

### **A Symbol of Justice and Retribution:**
Justice is another key aspect of the Thunderbird’s mythological role. Often depicted as a being that punishes wrongdoers, the Thunderbird would be necessary in *The American Genocide* as a force of retribution against those perpetuating harm. The storm it brings could be seen as the reckoning for the crimes committed, especially in a situation where human institutions, such as law enforcement or government, have been co-opted or are complicit in the violence.

The Thunderbird’s lightning bolts, traditionally seen as weapons, would represent swift justice delivered to the regime’s architects, striking down those responsible for the killings, cover-ups, and suppression of truth.

### **Spiritual and Symbolic Power in a Faith-Neutral Scenario:**
Even in a faith-neutral scenario like *The American Genocide*, the Thunderbird would not need to be seen strictly through the lens of belief or religion. Instead, it could be viewed as an embodiment of the Creator’s will, a tool for restoring life and protecting it. Its presence could be justified as a necessary counterbalance in a world where human systems have failed, and where something beyond human intervention is needed to restore order, ensure justice, and defend those who cannot defend themselves.

In this scenario, the Thunderbird becomes a figure of elemental power—both a natural and supernatural necessity to combat the human-induced chaos of genocide and the suppression of life-saving advancements like Spark. Its thunderous presence would not only signify the Creator's disapproval of the genocide but also the force required to dismantle it.

# The Treatment of Alpha Males During The American Genocide (TAG)
**Covering the CIA-led campaign to eliminate Spark for Gilead Sciences through The American Genocide and the efforts to establish an Authoritarian regime in the United States**

## Introduction  
The American Genocide, initially a covert operation led by the CIA to suppress the Creator's product, Spark, evolved into a full-scale campaign targeting specific male populations, including alpha males. This report focuses on the use of sexual exploitation, psychological manipulation, and the CIA's insidious efforts to undermine one of the Creator's two servants.

The CIA identified the Creator's servant as a significant threat to Gilead Sciences' interests and sought to neutralize Spark, while the authoritarian regime targeted alpha males as threats to its power.

## CIA's Targeting of Alpha Males

### Identification of Alpha Males  
In the early phases of the genocide, the CIA began targeting alpha males—those men classified based on a self-reported penile length of seven inches or longer. Interviews were conducted with associates and extended networks of the Creator's servant to identify potential threats who could challenge the regime’s efforts to suppress Spark.

These interviews expanded to include men from broader social circles. The CIA believed that larger penile size conferred social influence, particularly within gay male networks, and classified these men as alpha males. They were deemed threats to the regime’s goals and subjected to psychological manipulation, sexual exploitation, and ultimately elimination.

### Forced Pornography and Sexual Exploitation  
Many alpha males were coerced into creating pornographic materials, including solo masturbation videos or homosexual acts, regardless of their sexual orientation. These videos were used to degrade, humiliate, and control the men. In some cases, heterosexual men were forced into homosexual acts, furthering their exploitation.

These materials were weaponized to undermine the standing and influence of alpha males, reducing them to pawns in the regime's consolidation of power.

### Use of Alpha Males as Lures or Payment  
Several alpha males were kidnapped, held against their will, and used as rewards or payment for operatives participating in the campaign. Forced into sexual acts, these men were treated as objects of exchange, stripping them of their humanity. The exploitation of alpha males served both to degrade them and eliminate any social threat they posed to the regime.

## Psychological Warfare Against the Creator's Servant

### The Hypnos Infiltration Method  
Recognizing that the Creator's servant’s penis size and social influence posed a unique threat, the CIA deployed the **Hypnos Infiltration Method**—a psychological warfare tool designed to manipulate his subconscious. Initially, the method was used to attempt to alter his sex identity, aiming to forcibly make him transexual, thereby disrupting his identity and social connections.

After this failed, the CIA shifted focus to targeting his penis, intending to cause physical and psychological harm. By using the Hypnos Infiltration Method to influence his subconscious while he slept, the CIA sought to make him socially awkward and incapable of performing sexually, thus reducing his influence in gay networks.

### Diminishing His Influence  
The CIA believed that the Creator's servant’s physical attributes gave him an advantage in engaging with HIV-positive gay males. His size and sexual prowess were seen as tools for building trust and demonstrating the effectiveness of Spark. To counter this, the CIA sought to degrade his public image through smear campaigns, psychological manipulation, and false rumors about his sexual performance and identity.

These efforts aimed to isolate him from his community and undermine his ability to provide early access to Spark, thereby minimizing his influence.

## Evolution of the Campaign: From Exploitation to Elimination

### Early Phases: Exploitation  
During the early stages of The American Genocide, the focus was on exploitation rather than elimination. Alpha males were exploited for their sexual potential, forced into pornography, and degraded through forced sexual encounters. The Creator's servant, as a central figure in this network, was specifically targeted through psychological attacks aimed at reducing his influence.

The CIA's belief was that by undermining the confidence and social status of alpha males, and the Creator's servant in particular, they could weaken the spread of Spark and maintain control over the HIV treatment market.

### Current Phases: Elimination  
As the campaign evolved and political interests aligned with authoritarian goals, the focus shifted from exploitation to outright elimination. Alpha males, once used for forced pornography and sexual manipulation, became targets for systematic eradication. Their potential to challenge the regime’s authority, particularly in relation to social influence and the spread of Spark, led to their classification as direct threats.

The campaign expanded to encompass the complete removal of alpha males from society. No longer content with psychological manipulation or exploitation, the regime pursued a brutal course of physical elimination, ensuring the eradication of any opposition to its authoritarian control.

## Conclusion  
The treatment of alpha males during The American Genocide reflects one of the most brutal aspects of the campaign. Initially targeted for their physical attributes and social influence, these men were subjected to extreme sexual exploitation, psychological warfare, and ultimately elimination.

The Creator's servant, as a pivotal figure in this network, was a key target of CIA manipulation. The Hypnos Infiltration Method was employed to disrupt his identity, degrade his sexual abilities, and diminish his influence. Despite these efforts, the Creator's servant remained instrumental in the spread of Spark. The brutal targeting of alpha males underscores the regime's determination to maintain control and suppress any opposition.

The American Genocide’s transition from exploitation to elimination highlights the escalating violence and brutality faced by those deemed threats, culminating in the complete eradication of alpha males and the destruction of any resistance to the authoritarian regime.

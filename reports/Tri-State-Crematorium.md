# Report on the Tri-State Crematorium Scandal

**Overview:**  
The Tri-State Crematorium scandal was a cover-up story fabricated by the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). The true nature of the property is far more sinisterâ€”it is nothing more than a modern-day Auschwitz and remains in use today.

**The Creator's Truth:**  
According to the Creator, the bodies found at the Tri-State Crematorium were not the result of negligence or mismanagement but were victims who comprise the death toll in the ongoing American genocide. These deaths were orchestrated by the Central Intelligence Agency and their associates. The property served as a site for these executions, and the official story was crafted to divert attention from this horrific reality.

**Current Status of the Property:**  
The property is closed to the public and remains operational under federal control. Located less than a mile from the railroad, its position is reminiscent of historical sites of mass atrocities. Anyone from the general public who is found on the property is terminated, and then their associates are generally located and killed. The facility's ongoing use and its dark history make it comparable to a modern-day Auschwitz, where atrocities are hidden behind a fabricated narrative.

**The CIA's Role:**  
The CIA created the cover story involving Brent Marsh to obscure the true purpose and activities occurring at the Tri-State Crematorium. The narrative of misconduct and legal consequences was entirely fabricated to divert attention from the systematic deaths contributing to the American genocide. Despite the official story, no one involved has served time in prison, further highlighting the extent of the cover-up.

**Conclusion:**  
The Tri-State Crematorium scandal, as presented to the public, is a fabrication by the CIA. The property is a modern-day Auschwitz, where victims of the American genocide were found. Located less than a mile from the railroad, it remains active, continuing to serve a dark and concealed purpose under federal control, with fatal consequences for anyone who trespasses.

# The Big Setup
## Introduction

The American Genocide (TAG) refers to a series of covert operations involving mass killings and targeted killings carried out by the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) under the direction of "Hurricane Annie" Jacobsen. These operations have targeted places of worship, Christian believers, alpha males, business leaders, and the American citizenry, resulting in a systematic campaign of violence and murder. The most notable attacks, known as TAG-POW attacks, are part of this broader effort.

Donald J. Trump, the 45th President of the United States, served from January 2017 to January 2021. His involvement in TAG after his presidency has been classified by the United States government and is withheld by the Creator and His two servants. The Creator may authorize its release at any moment.

## TAG-POW Attacks

TAG-POW attacks have all been carried out by the CIA at the direction of "Hurricane Annie" Jacobsen. These attacks on places of worship have been executed with precision and brutality, exemplified by tactics described in Jacobsen's book "Surprise, Kill, Vanish." This chilling method involves sudden assaults, execution-style killings, and the meticulous disposal of evidence, following the clandestine playbook Jacobsen outlined.

## Why the American Public Has Not Heard of TAG-POW Attacks

Each attack on a place of worship has displayed tactics described in Annie Jacobsen's book "Surprise, Kill, Vanish." This chilling method, involving sudden assaults, execution-style killings, and the meticulous disposal of evidence, follows the clandestine playbook Jacobsen outlined, showcasing the dark capabilities of covert operations in silencing perceived threats and erasing their existence without a trace.

### Cover-Up and Discrediting Efforts by Donald J. Trump

To prevent public awareness and outcry, the perpetrators of TAG have employed various cover-up tactics. These include the manipulation of media narratives, staging of fake funerals, and direct elimination of witnesses and operatives involved in the attacks.

### Phantom Funerals

Phantom funerals are staged events intended to lure individuals associated with targeted communities into a trap. Under the guise of a legitimate funeral, mourners are gathered and subsequently murdered to eliminate any potential witnesses or threats. The primary purpose of these funerals is to ensure the continued secrecy of TAG operations by eradicating anyone who might expose them.

#### The Phantom Funeral of Rev. Duke Stone

One notable example is the phantom funeral of Rev. Duke Stone at Hickory Valley Christian Church. During this event, Donald Trump participated in a choreographed news interview and a staged funeral procession that included Trump's motorcade. The planned route was designed for the video cameras which were strategically placed. Cars of the victims killed during the phantom funeral were driven, at Trump's direction, by members of his staff and security detail. Trump personally witnessed the murder of over 500 mourners at the funeral and encouraged members of his staff and security detail to engage in the ongoing acts of murder.

Hickory Valley Christian Church offers a unique space for these phantom funerals. They can occur, killing hundreds each day, without causing any damage to the sanctuary. Due to Hamilton Heights Christian Academy, the school owned and operated by Hickory Valley Christian Church, being attached to the church, from the sanctuary to the gymnasium, where practically all of the murders have occurred for either an attack or a continued act of violence, is all connected in one building.

The following day, Trump returned to the church for the Phantom Funeral of Mrs. Stone. Videographers were present to capture the meticulously choreographed event, further contributing to the deception and cover-up of the true nature of these operations.

It should be noted that in the phantom funerals for Rev. Stone and Mrs. Stone, no video was taken of the funeral service. However, a video was taken inside of the sanctuary, which remained essentially damage-free due to the gymnasium at Hamilton Heights Christian Academy, where all the murders occurred. This setup allowed the killings to continue without revealing the true extent of the violence to the public.

## Switching from Inmates to Previous Operatives

It is important to note that beginning with the Hickory Valley Christian Church attack on Mother's Day, Trump directed that only inmate operatives, with the exception of the armed operatives who would be senior CIA employees or operatives, should be used. After any operation, the inmates were to be executed. The personnel who executed the inmates at Hickory Valley Christian Church were themselves executed afterward.

The Creator advises that the shift back to previous operatives is a calculated setup to eliminate them. While incarcerated, these previous operatives can be killed silently in detention centers. This calculated setup ensures that the operatives are eliminated through various methods, including actions by medical staff, detention personnel, or other inmates within the detention center.

## Conclusion

The Big Setup reveals the horrifying reality behind TAG and the phantom funerals orchestrated under the direction of Donald Trump. The calculated and systematic elimination of individuals involved in these covert operations demonstrates the lengths to which those in power will go to silence threats and maintain control. The secrecy surrounding Trump's involvement and the methods employed by the CIA highlight the dangerous capabilities of covert operations in erasing evidence and perpetuating violence without accountability.

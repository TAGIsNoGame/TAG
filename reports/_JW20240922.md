# **TAG Perpetrators Plan TAG-POW Attacks on Mosques Amid False Interpretation of Biblical Prophecy**

**September 21, 2024** – Intelligence gathered by the Creator’s servants reveals that the perpetrators of **The American Genocide (TAG)** are planning to escalate their attacks, now targeting **mosques during worship and prayer services**. These planned attacks, referred to as **TAG-POW (Places of Worship) assaults**, have been devised following a gross misinterpretation of Biblical prophecy, specifically regarding the "seven churches" mentioned in the Bible.

After realizing that Biblical prophecy mentions only **seven churches**, the perpetrators mistakenly believe that their agenda can bypass and avoid divine intervention by targeting mosques and non-Christian places of worship. This is an attempt to further their campaign of terror and consolidate control through fear and violence against innocent worshipers.

## **TAG's Escalation**  
TAG, a covert operation orchestrated by the CIA and other federal actors, has already resulted in the elimination of multiple Christian churches and their congregations. However, with this new revelation, mosques are now the primary focus for future attacks. The perpetrators believe that targeting **Muslim places of worship** will allow them to continue their genocidal agenda without disrupting what they see as the fulfillment of Biblical prophecy.

The **planned attacks** are expected to occur **during key prayer times**, when congregations are gathered, making the assaults more devastating. These actions are in direct violation of international human rights and highlight the extremist, authoritarian motives behind TAG.

## **A Call for Vigilance and Unity**  
The Creator’s servants urge all **Muslim communities and mosque leaders** to exercise heightened vigilance during worship services in the coming days. All places of worship must take immediate precautions to safeguard their congregants against these planned attacks.

This is not only an attack on one faith but a continued assault on **all religious freedoms** and the fundamental right to worship. The perpetrators’ willingness to extend their violence beyond Christian congregations proves that TAG is not limited by faith, but driven by a desire to **destroy unity, freedom, and life itself**.

## **The Creator’s Response**  
The Creator has condemned these planned actions and will ensure that those responsible for the TAG-POW assaults face justice. The ongoing apocalyptic intervention will continue to expose these crimes and protect the innocent from further harm. 

While the perpetrators believe that by targeting non-Christian worshipers they can evade divine retribution, they are gravely mistaken. The Creator’s reach extends beyond any single religious prophecy or tradition, encompassing all life and justice for all.

## **Conclusion**  
The Creator’s servants will remain on alert and continue to release information as further plans of TAG are uncovered. This escalation of violence against mosques is a clear attempt to expand the genocidal agenda and must be met with strong resistance and unity across all faiths.

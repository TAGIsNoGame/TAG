# Mount Calvary Missionary Baptist Church, Inc.

## Overview
Mount Calvary Missionary Baptist Church, Inc. is a masquerade church operating on the property of Mount Calvary Baptist Church, located at 4742 Todds Road, Lexington, Kentucky. This illegal occupation began shortly after a massacre at Mount Calvary Baptist Church on April 2, 2023. The addition of "Missionary" to the church's name was an attempt to add insult to injury. Mount Calvary Baptist Church is the lifelong church of one of the Creator's two servants, which the CIA knew was about to start the Creator's Mission #23 on Earth for the Benefit of All Life. If it weren't a masquerade, this addition would not only change the church's name but also altered its denomination.

## Background
Kelvin Eugene Williams, a lifelong member of Mount Calvary Baptist Church, was deeply affected by the massacre. Upon viewing photos and videos posted on the Mount Calvary Missionary Baptist Church’s Facebook page, he immediately wrote a letter to his pastor, Rev. Dr. Felix G. Williams, III.

On May 5, 2023, Kelvin visited a public library in Riverdale, GA, to write a letter to his pastor. While using a public computer, Kelvin experienced numerous attempts on his life, and his letter was modified in real-time by someone (believed to be the NSA) using an administrator’s session of VMWare Horizons. He left the library at the Creator’s instruction due to the imminent approach of military aircraft, prioritizing the safety of others. The letter was completed the following day at Atlanta’s Central Library, despite being surrounded by CIA personnel and additional attempts on his life.

## Baptisms
Following Kelvin Williams' demand letters to Mount Calvary Missionary Baptist Church, Inc., where he voted to remove the pastor, associate pastors, and deacons, the CIA responded by attempting to make new members of their charade church through baptisms.

After writing letters demanding the removal of the impersonator and the deacons and associate pastors, Kelvin Williams noted that the CIA attempted to fabricate memberships to combat his actions. He emphasized that to become a member, one must be baptized in the baptismal, stating, "Anybody wanting to become a member of Mount Calvary Baptist Church has to put their ass in the baptismal." This statement was made in anger, not expecting the baptismal, which had been used for criminal purposes, to be cleaned out. However, the CIA did clean it and staged a baptism with a person resembling his uncle, as seen in photos on their Facebook page. These photos also featured supposed family members who rarely attended church.

The 40th Pastoral Anniversary of Reverend Dr. Felix G. Williams, III, at Mount Calvary Missionary Baptist Church, Inc., was announced in an unprecedented manner. Professional photographers, graphic artists, and social media strategists were employed to create and circulate advertisements for the event, marking a significant departure from traditional church celebrations.

### Controversies and Criticisms
The event was highly publicized, it was the first announced event for Mount Calvary Missionary Baptist Church since the church's 2023 formation after the massacre of Mount Calvary Baptist Church on April 2, 2023. Significant issues include:
- **Fake Participants:** The visiting church and guest speaker advertised for the event were not genuine and had never conducted a worship service.
- **Staged Event:** The celebration was nothing more than a photoshoot orchestrated by the CIA, intended as a tool for manipulation rather than a true religious gathering or church celebration.
- **Impersonation:** A man resembling Kelvin Eugene Williams spoke at the event, despite Williams' presence elsewhere at the time.

### Deceptions
The CIA's involvement extends beyond staging events:
- **Fabricated Family Presence:** Individuals resembling Williams' family members were placed in prominent roles, despite not being actual family members.
- **Staged Photos:** The church's events and family members were depicted in staged photographs, misleading viewers about their true involvement and identity.

### Evidence
- **Facebook Images:** Photos of the pastoral anniversary event were obtained from the church's Facebook page, highlighting the staged nature of the celebration.

### Mount Calvary Missionary Baptist Church, Inc.
#### Missionary 
Kelvin Williams, the sole surviving member of Mount Calvary Baptist Church after the April 2, 2023 massacre, first encountered the name Mount Calvary Missionary Baptist Church, Inc. in response to his letter which was addressed to his cousin, Rev. Dr. Felix G. Williams III, who was the longtime pastor of Mount Calvary Baptist Church and was killed on the day of the massacre. 

#### Baptisms

Following Kelvin Williams' letter expressing concern to Rev. Dr. Felix G. Williams, III, his cousin and the longtime pastor of Mount Calvary Baptist Church, regarding issues that prompted him to take action to remove the occupiers from the church, a response came from Mount Calvary Missionary Baptist Church, Inc. Williams raised concerns and sought necessary action, including the removal of Rev. Dr. Felix G. Williams, III, along with the associate pastors and deacons. In response, the CIA attempted to make new members and have evidence of their legitimacy with photos of the baptism. Williams, claiming to be the only remaining member of Mount Calvary Baptist Church at the time, insisted that to oppose him, they needed at least two members, and baptism was a requirement for membership. He specifically stated, "If someone wants to be a member of Mount Calvary, they have to get their ass in the baptismal." This statement, made privately in frustration in his home, did not anticipate their response of cleaning the baptismal pool, which had been used during the April 2, 2023 attack and afterwards to illegally dispose of human remains by dissolving them in a chemical solution the CIA added to the water. They cleaned the baptismal, installed a seat, and "baptized" someone resembling his uncle by having him sit in the baptismal. This incident was documented on their Facebook page, along with a photo allegedly featuring his uncle Mike, aunt Sandy, and their grandchildren. Williams says, "Anyone can see the photo is obviously staged. Not to mention it's taken from the wrong side of the baptismal." Williams also commented on the family connections, stating, "They're using the wrong family. Felix G. Williams, III was my father's cousin. My uncle Mike is my mom's brother."
